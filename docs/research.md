# HFT Bot Development Roadmap and Market Research Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines a step-by-step plan for building a high-frequency trading (HFT) bot that detects real-time market anomalies—specifically, abnormal price movements and volume spikes. It also covers key market research insights and trading concepts, ensuring that you not only build a robust technical solution but also gain a deeper understanding of how financial markets work.

## Part 1: Market Research and Trading Concepts

### 1. High-Frequency Trading (HFT)
- **Definition:** HFT involves using powerful computers to execute a large number of trades at extremely high speeds (often measured in microseconds). The goal is to capitalize on very small price discrepancies.
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - **Ultra-Low Latency:** Minimizing the time between receiving market data and executing trades.
  - **Algorithmic Trading:** Strategies are automated, relying on pre-programmed logic.
  - **High Throughput:** The system processes thousands of data points and transactions per second.
- **Market Impact:** HFT can improve market liquidity but also raises concerns about market volatility and flash crashes.

### 2. Market Microstructure
- **Bid-Ask Spread:**
  - **Definition:** The difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (ask).
  - **Significance:** A narrow spread typically indicates high liquidity, while a wider spread may signal low liquidity or market stress.
- **Order Book Dynamics:**
  - The order book is a real-time list of buy and sell orders for a specific security.
  - HFT algorithms often analyze order book depth to predict short-term price movements.

### 3. Price Movements and Volatility
- **Price Movement:**
  - **Definition:** The change in the stock’s price over time.
  - **Abnormal Movements:** These are significant deviations from the recent average price, often measured in terms of standard deviation (σ). For example, a price change greater than 2σ from the moving average may indicate an anomaly.
- **Volatility:**
  - **Definition:** The degree of variation in trading prices over time.
  - **Relevance:** High volatility may signal potential trading opportunities, but it also increases risk.

### 4. Trading Volume
- **Definition:** The number of shares or contracts traded during a given period.
- **Volume Spikes:**
  - **Abnormal Volume:** Sudden, sharp increases in volume can indicate major market events or shifts in investor sentiment.
  - **Analysis:** Comparing current volume to a moving average of historical volume can help flag unusual activity.

### 5. Real-Time Data and APIs
- **Live Market Data:** For HFT, using live data is critical. Unlike historical data (which is used for backtesting), real-time data reflects current market conditions.
- **Data Providers:**
  - **Alpaca API:** Offers a real-time WebSocket streaming API, ideal for prototyping with paper trading support.
  - **IEX Cloud:** Provides real-time U.S. stock market data.
  - **Binance API:** Suited for cryptocurrency markets, providing high-frequency data streams.

## Part 2: Technical Roadmap for Building the HFT Bot

### Project Goals
- **Real-Time Data Ingestion:** Replace simulated data with live market data.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identify abnormal price movements and volume spikes.
- **Ultra-Low Latency Processing:** Utilize ZeroMQ and C++ concurrency to handle high-frequency updates.
- **User Alerts:** Notify users immediately when anomalies are detected.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Ensure the design can be extended to multiple instruments and advanced detection logic.

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Planning
- **Development Tools:**
  - Use a modern C++ compiler (supporting C++17 or later).
  - Set up your project with CMake.
  - Install ZeroMQ for messaging and, optionally, Boost for additional concurrency utilities.
- **Concept Familiarization:**
  - Study the market terms discussed above (HFT, bid-ask spread, volatility, etc.).
  - Define clear anomaly detection criteria for price movements and volume spikes.
- **High-Level Architecture:**
  - **Data Ingestion:** Module to connect to a live data API.
  - **Anomaly Detection:** Module to process incoming data using statistical measures (e.g., moving averages, standard deviations).
  - **Alerting:** Module to notify the user (initially via console output, later via more sophisticated channels).

### Phase 2: Market Data Ingestion System
- **API Integration:**
  - **Choose an API:** Start with a free, real-time data API like the Alpaca API for its ease-of-use and robust WebSocket streaming.
  - **Establish Connection:** Replace the simulated data function (`simulateMarketData()`) with one that connects to the API.
  - **Data Parsing:** Adapt your `MarketData` structure to the API’s data format (price, volume, bid, ask, timestamp).
- **Asynchronous I/O:**
  - Utilize non-blocking calls (via Boost.Asio or similar) to fetch data.
  - Ensure that your ingestion module operates on its own thread or process to avoid delays.

### Phase 3: Real-Time Anomaly Detection Engine
- **Abnormal Price Movements:**
  - **Methodology:** Compute a short-term moving average and standard deviation. Flag any price that deviates by more than a defined threshold (e.g., 2 standard deviations).
  - **Implementation:** Maintain and update statistics incrementally for each new data tick.
- **Volume Spikes:**
  - **Methodology:** Calculate a moving average for trading volume. Identify spikes when the current volume exceeds a set multiple (e.g., 3×) of this average.
  - **Implementation:** Ensure that these checks run quickly in constant time per update.
- **Integration with Data Feed:**
  - Use ZeroMQ (or a thread-safe queue) to receive live data and process it immediately.
  - Test detection logic with both simulated anomalies and real market data.

### Phase 4: User Alerting System
- **Alert Design:**
  - Create clear alert messages that include the type of anomaly, the symbol, and key details (e.g., “AAPL price moved 2.5σ above its moving average”).
- **Alert Dispatch:**
  - Initially send alerts to the console.
  - Optionally, implement additional channels such as email, SMS, or a dashboard interface.
- **Non-Blocking Operations:**
  - Ensure that sending alerts does not block the main data processing loop (consider using asynchronous messaging or a separate thread for alerts).

### Phase 5: Optimization and Ultra-Low Latency Improvements
- **Performance Profiling:**
  - Insert timestamps at key stages to measure latency.
  - Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.
- **Memory and Concurrency Optimization:**
  - Reuse buffers and minimize dynamic memory allocation.
  - Explore lock-free data structures or atomic operations to reduce synchronization overhead.
- **ZeroMQ Tuning:**
  - Optimize socket settings and consider in-process transport options for components on the same machine.
- **Iterative Refinement:**
  - Continuously test under simulated high-load conditions and refine your code for maximum efficiency.

### Phase 6: Scaling Up and Future Enhancements
- **Scaling for More Instruments:**
  - Distribute processing across multiple threads or processes.
  - Partition data by instrument symbol to avoid bottlenecks.
- **Modularity:**
  - Design the system so new anomaly detection methods (such as inter-stock correlations) can be added without major refactoring.
- **Integration with Trading Execution:**
  - Separate detection logic from execution. Once the detection is reliable, consider adding a module to place orders automatically via a broker API.
- **System Monitoring and Robustness:**
  - Implement error handling, reconnection logic, and performance monitoring to ensure reliability in production environments.
