# HFT Bot Development Roadmap and Research Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a detailed roadmap for building a high-frequency trading (HFT) bot that detects real-time market anomalies—specifically abnormal price movements and volume spikes. It covers the key concepts, technology choices, and development phases, with a focus on using real-time data through an API rather than historical/simulated data. The goal is to build a system that is both extremely fast (using ZeroMQ and concurrency in C++) and educational, allowing you to learn about market dynamics along the way.

## Project Goals

- **Real-Time Data Ingestion:** Replace simulated data with live, up-to-date market data.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Detect abnormal price movements (significant deviations from short-term moving averages) and volume spikes (unexpected surges relative to recent averages).
- **Ultra-Low Latency Processing:** Leverage ZeroMQ for fast messaging and C++ concurrency to handle high-frequency updates.
- **User Alerts:** Provide immediate notifications (via console or other channels) when anomalies are detected.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Design the system to scale up as you add more instruments or additional detection algorithms.

## Key Technologies and Concepts

- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT):**  
  HFT involves automated trading strategies executed at extremely high speeds (often in microseconds). The focus is on minimizing latency and processing large volumes of market data quickly.

- **ZeroMQ:**  
  A high-performance asynchronous messaging library used to implement a publish/subscribe (pub-sub) pattern. In this project, ZeroMQ will connect data ingestion, anomaly detection, and alerting components with minimal overhead.

- **C++ Concurrency:**  
  Use threads, mutexes, and possibly lock-free data structures to process data in parallel. Modern C++ (C++17 and above) offers built-in concurrency features that help minimize latency.

- **Real-Time Market Data APIs:**  
  Instead of relying on simulated data, live market data will be used. Recommended APIs include:
  - **Alpaca API:**  
    Offers a robust WebSocket streaming API for real-time stock data and supports paper trading, making it ideal for prototyping. It is well-documented and beginner-friendly.
  - **IEX Cloud:**  
    Provides real-time market data for U.S. stocks, although real-time access may require a paid plan.
  - **Binance API:**  
    A popular choice for cryptocurrency markets that offers high-frequency data streams.

- **Anomaly Detection Techniques:**  
  - **Abnormal Price Movements:**  
    Use a moving average and standard deviation approach to flag prices that deviate significantly (e.g., more than 2 standard deviations) from the average.
  - **Volume Spikes:**  
    Compare current volume to a short-term moving average. A spike (e.g., 3× the average) may indicate unusual market activity.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Planning

- **Tool and Library Setup:**
  - Install a modern C++ compiler supporting C++17 or higher.
  - Set up the project using CMake.
  - Install ZeroMQ for messaging.
  - Optionally install Boost for additional concurrency/networking utilities (though modern C++ features may suffice).

- **Learn Key Market Concepts:**
  - Understand HFT, bid-ask spread, trading volume, moving averages, and standard deviations.
  - Research how real-time data is used in trading.

- **Define Project Scope:**
  - Focus on detecting abnormal price movements and volume spikes.
  - Identify the instruments (e.g., U.S. stocks or cryptocurrencies) you wish to monitor.

- **Plan Data Access:**
  - Choose a real-time market data API (detailed below in API Recommendations).

- **High-Level System Architecture:**
  - **Data Ingestion:** Connect to the API and continuously stream market data.
  - **Anomaly Detection:** Process each data tick to detect price and volume anomalies.
  - **Alerting:** Dispatch notifications when anomalies occur.
  - Use ZeroMQ’s pub-sub model to decouple these components for low-latency performance.

### Phase 2: Market Data Ingestion System

- **Connect to a Live Data Source:**
  - Replace the `simulateMarketData()` function with one that connects to a real-time market data API.
  - Use a WebSocket connection if available (preferred for low latency).

- **Data Parsing:**
  - Adjust the `MarketData` structure to include fields provided by the API (price, volume, bid, ask, timestamp, etc.).
  - Implement JSON (or appropriate format) parsing to extract these fields.

- **Non-Blocking I/O:**
  - Use asynchronous methods (via Boost.Asio, cURL, or similar) to ensure data ingestion does not block processing.

- **Testing the Ingestion Module:**
  - Print or log incoming data to verify successful integration with the API.

### Phase 3: Real-Time Anomaly Detection Engine

- **Abnormal Price Movement Detection:**
  - Maintain a short-term moving average for each stock.
  - Compute the standard deviation and flag any price that deviates more than a preset threshold (e.g., 2 standard deviations).
  
- **Volume Spike Detection:**
  - Calculate a moving average of trading volume.
  - Flag a volume spike if the current volume exceeds a set multiple (e.g., 3×) of the moving average.

- **Integrate with Live Data:**
  - Subscribe to the data feed using ZeroMQ (or a thread-safe queue if in a single process).
  - Process each tick in real time, performing the necessary statistical checks.

- **Ensure Efficiency:**
  - Keep calculations simple and in constant time per tick.
  - Optimize by updating statistics incrementally rather than recomputing from scratch.

### Phase 4: User Alerting System

- **Design Alert Mechanisms:**
  - Define clear, concise alert messages (e.g., “Price anomaly for AAPL: Price deviated by 2.5σ from the moving average”).
  
- **Implement Alert Dispatch:**
  - Initially output alerts to the console or a log file.
  - Plan for future enhancements like sending emails, SMS, or updating a dashboard.

- **Ensure Non-Blocking Operations:**
  - Use asynchronous dispatch (via a separate thread or ZeroMQ messaging) to avoid delaying the anomaly detection loop.

### Phase 5: Optimization and Ultra-Low Latency Improvements

- **Profile and Measure:**
  - Insert timestamps at key stages (data ingestion, processing, alert dispatch) to measure latency.
  
- **Memory and Concurrency Optimization:**
  - Reuse buffers and minimize dynamic memory allocations.
  - Consider lock-free data structures or atomic operations to reduce synchronization overhead.

- **Tune ZeroMQ Settings:**
  - Optimize socket options and consider in-process transports for components on the same machine.

- **Iterative Testing:**
  - Stress-test the system under simulated high-load conditions and refine as necessary.

### Phase 6: Scaling Up and Future Enhancements

- **Handling More Instruments:**
  - Distribute data processing across multiple threads or processes.
  - Implement workload partitioning (e.g., by instrument symbol) to avoid bottlenecks.

- **Modular Expansion:**
  - Add new anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., cross-instrument correlation checks) without overhauling the existing system.
  
- **Future Integration with Trading:**
  - Separate detection from execution so the bot can eventually place trades automatically via a broker API.
  
- **Robustness and Monitoring:**
  - Implement error handling, reconnection logic, and real-time system monitoring for health and performance.

## API Recommendations

For a project focused on real-time market data with a low-latency requirement, here are the top recommendations:

- **Alpaca API (Recommended):**
  - **Real-Time Data:** Offers a robust WebSocket streaming API ideal for live market updates.
  - **Paper Trading:** Provides free paper trading accounts, making it safe and cost-effective to prototype.
  - **Ease of Use:** Well-documented and friendly for beginners.
  - **Scalability:** Suitable for both small prototypes and larger production systems.
  
- **IEX Cloud:**
  - Offers real-time U.S. stock market data, though accessing the full data stream might require a paid plan.
  
- **Binance API:**
  - Best suited if you are interested in cryptocurrency markets. It provides high-frequency data and low-latency performance similar to what you’d need for HFT.

Given your project’s focus on learning about market data and implementing a live, real-time system, **Alpaca API** is recommended for its balance of ease-of-use, cost (free paper trading), and robust real-time streaming capabilities.

## Conclusion

This document outlines the detailed research and step-by-step roadmap for building your HFT bot with real-time anomaly detection. We will:
